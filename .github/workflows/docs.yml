    steps:

      # ensuring it includes any changes made by that workflow (like the coverage badge).
      - name: Checkout repository

      # Step 2: Set up Python

        with:
          python-version: "3.12" # Specify the Python version

      # Step 3: Install uv package manager
      # Using curl to install uv and add uv to the system PATH

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: uv sync --extra cpu --group docs # Install dependencies from the 'docs' group and 'cpu' extra

      # Step 6: Build the MkDocs site
      - name: Build the MkDocs site
        run: mkdocs build # Run the mkdocs build command

      # Step 7: Deploy the built site to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
