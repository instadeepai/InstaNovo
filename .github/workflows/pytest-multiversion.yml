# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a variety of Python versions
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python

# Workflow name
# If you change this name, also update the name in the docs.yml workflow
name: Test, Lint, and Update Coverage Badge

# Triggers for the workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"] # Run on pushes to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"] # Run on pull requests targeting the main branch

# Concurrency control
concurrency:
  # Group runs by workflow name and the Git ref (branch or tag)
  # Ensures only one run proceeds for the same workflow and ref at a time
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  # Cancel any ongoing runs for the same group (workflow + ref) when a new run starts
  cancel-in-progress: true

# Define the jobs to run
jobs:
  build:
    # Define permissions needed for the job
    permissions:
      contents: write # Allow writing repository content (for committing the badge)
      pull-requests: read # Allow reading pull request details

    # Define the strategy for running jobs in parallel
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false # Don't cancel other jobs if one fails
      matrix:
        # Define the matrix combinations
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"] # Python versions to test
        os: [ubuntu-latest] # Operating systems to test on

    # Specify the runner environment for the job
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    # Define the steps within the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install uv and set up Python

          pyproject-file: "pyproject.toml" # Specify the pyproject.toml file
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} # Use Python version from matrix

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: uv sync --extra cpu --dev # Install main and dev dependencies, CI runs on 'cpu' only

      # Step 4: Lint code with pre-commit
      - name: Lint with pre-commit
        run: uv run pre-commit run --all-files -c .pre-commit-config.yaml # Run all pre-commit hooks

      # Step 5: Run tests with pytest and generate coverage report

          uv run coverage report -m --fail-under=0
        # Note: --fail-under=0 prevents this step from failing due to low coverage,
        # allowing the badge to be generated. Consider adding a separate step
        # later in the workflow to enforce a minimum coverage threshold if desired.
